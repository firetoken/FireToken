Democracy is a privilege we often take for granted. The privilege of being able to let each individual voice be heard and counted were often fought and protected, at a great cost. We are witnessing the rise of blockchain and the forming of a new decentralized, virtual currency system. Cryptocurrency represents an evolution of our global monetary system. A system that can be universally accepted and stored wealth can be quickly transferable across the internet.
We know that cryptocurrency is in its infancy stage. We see the potential improvements blockchain technology can bring to our world. This new technology is not meant to immediately replace our current system, but rather an addition to improve what we already have. Due to the infancy stage cryptocurrency is in, we often experience many rise and fall of multiple systems, as well as wide spread manipulation of data, value and interpretation. With any new innovation, there will be resistance. The actions and mistakes made today will lay the foundation of a better system tomorrow. Innovations that were stand-alone will be combined to produce a better product in the future. Many cryptocurrencies will fall, some will persist and eventually be universally accepted. FireToken may be one to persists, or we may be replaced by a better system. Until then, we will do our part of contributing what we are capable of, in order to achieve the overall improvement of blockchain technology.
Our decentralized voting program is enabled for all FireToken’s prospective hosts and FireTokens holders immediately after distribution. This instruction will walk you through how to set up and participate in our decentralized voting process.
