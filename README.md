FireToken ICO is now completed. We will be launching our services soon to our members. The current bot testings we are running may include migration of new members from other groups. 
We are also running other trading bots on the exchanges and a multitude of automatic functions that aims at providing our members with better services. Please excuse our brute tactic at the moment. 


Tokens withdrawal will be enabled for all members at the same time after our distribution ends.
The staking and voting systems will be in place for you after ICO and distribution to use as well. Staking and voting are completely decentralized. Hosting API widget coding instruction will be provided as well for interested hosts. Free blockchain voting for FireToken stakeholders will provides great utility for those who wishes to create their own polls, questions, elections, or simply to collect better public data. 
Some changes will also be made on our website, regarding the maximum cap staking payment explanation. The changes are democractically agreed upon by our management team to avoids negative interpretation of unsustainable payout structure by future potential investors. 
We want the future market to not limited their focus on the possible maximum staking reward, but on FireToken system and its network.
